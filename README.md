## Proposal Draft and Initial Idea!

An app primarilay focused on Video Calls/Meetings for teams working on projects that will improve their productivity.

#### The Features Proposed:

- Users can _create/update/remove_ Events for future meetings and invite participants.
- Invitation can be sent only to accounts in the user's friend list. (Simply put there will be connections/friends section which is similar to most social media apps)
- The maximum number of participants allowed for a video call will be capped at 6 participants. (according to [forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/04/15/why-smaller-teams-are-better-than-larger-ones/?sh=7ef3c2d1e686) and other's study, it shows small team tends to have better productivity)
- The video duration will also be limited to a maximum of 25 mins. After that the video call will auto close.
- Partipants in the meeting can not turn off the video for more than 5 mins. After 5 mins their video will auto turn on.
- Inactive participants (like no movements and other tracking methods) will be auto kicked out from the meeting. But they can rejoin again.
- Participants can collaborate with an interactive whiteboards and share the images to others.
- Participants can create a real time Poll with questions and 4 options.
- Paricipants can take notes with a powerful notion like editor and save it to their account in the dashboard and also share it to other account.
- The Note Taking Feature will be a heavy focus on our app also. So, users can take notes and manage products during and outside of video calls. The notes will be very powerful like _notion_ with all the editing feature like tables and views.
- Users can manage projects with notes and tasks in the notes with real time collaboration feature.
- There will be also a template store for different kinds of notes for effectivity.

## Features Removed from the Final Draft:

- The video duration should not be limited to 25 mins. This might be very incovenient for teams that require more time for meets. Instead of being more productive it will be the opposite of it.
- Auto enabling of video might be bad for the user experience of the participants having bad network conditions.
- Auto kicking of inactive users might not be accurate hamper the flow of the meeting.
- Interactive Dashboard, Interactive Poll, Networking and Template store features due to the lack of time.
- Most of the Notes features are also not been possible for the lack of time.
